# inventory-app

In this project I will be creating and Inventory management app for an imaginary store. This app will have categorues and items, so when the user goes to the home-page they can view items by category.

I will include all of the CRUD methods for both items and categories as well.

For this project from The Odin Project, I will be using NodeJS and Express to build this inventory app that incorporates key skills like database management, API design, and CRUD functionality.
